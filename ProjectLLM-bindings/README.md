# ProjectLLM Language Bindings
These are the language bindings for the ProjectLLM backend. They provide functionality to load ProjectLLM models (and other llama.cpp models), generate text, and (in the case of the Python bindings) embed text as a vector representation.

See their respective folders for language-specific documentation.

### Languages
- [Python](https://github.com/nomic-ai/ProjectLLM/tree/main/ProjectLLM-bindings/python) (Nomic official, maintained by [@cebtenzzre](https://github.com/cebtenzzre))
